## installation



## usage


## time_spent

I am traditionally a springboot coder, and since i had stayed a long time without coding with the django framework, i took the first week to make some reviews and learn some concepts in django. I started the actuall coding the second week. So, 1 week for revising, 1 week for coding. I am already familiar with react, so it was straight forward.

## The_likes

- I liked the concept of frequently updating frontend data with the backend
- I liked the fact that i dived back into django, a framework which i hadn't touched in a while
- I did not like the time frame provided, it was too short especially for my condition
- In the beginning, i had a hard time to understand the project's objectives, even though i figured it out with time, it was initially hard.

## The_Alternatives

If i had more time, i would first update intensively the frontend ( i believe what a user see is what sells the app). Then, i would add more functionalities like team project tracking where many users can track their activities as a team.

## The_Satisfaction

Even though the frontend is not the best, i am nevertheless satisfied given the time spent and the result. I am also satisfied with the tracking logic, especially the sync functionality that frequently updates the frontend with up to date time informations. I am particularly glad i didn't have to use websockets to do it.

## The_Improvement

- The frontend!! like i earlier mentioned.
- Add websocket for better performance ( will eventually need it if the app had to scale)
